# odin-recipes

This is the first odin learning project. Basic html elements such as text elements (p, h1, etc..), anchor elements (a, link), image elements (img), and list elements (ul, ol, li) will be used, as well as their attributes to change them to my desire. This is a recipe website built using knowledge from html foundations.
